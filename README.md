# Bantu_AI
 This is similar to Jarvis AI but operated only within the Bhaskara Raju Vathsavai's family

GOAL: I will create an AI that uses my voice primarily as a security feature. Additionally, it will modified to only interact with the people you invite as part of the family, by signing in with your email. In the future, it will be shared to other families having it's own personality that fits its family.

    NOTE: I have used Microsoft Copilot to assist me in making this possible and I used its assistance most of the time because I didn't understand what most of the code did. I will promise that I using it only for learning purposes and nothing else. 

 1) I have finished the basic structure of what the AI does and how it should react, but there is still more to finish as I uncover new ways to store my own voice as part of the recognition process. For this AI, I have used a pre-trained model known as DialoGPT-medium, which uses microsoft AI. Basic Structure: FINISHED

 2) So far I was testing and I came across errors that are unknown to my knowledge of understanding. However, I was able to identify the error, which includes manually choosing an audio file. I found this un-acceptable as this was not the objective of using an AI. So I have asked co-pilot to assist me to automatically change audio files based on different questions asked by the user. Error Testing: FINISHED
